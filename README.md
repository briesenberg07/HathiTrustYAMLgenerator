# YAMLgenerator
## Python script and documentation adapted from [yaml-generator-for-hathitrust](https://github.com/ruthtillman/yaml-generator-for-hathitrust) created by [ruthtillman](https://github.com/ruthtillman)  
### This repository includes a Python script which uses an input CSV file to generate a YAML metadata file or files for uploading material to the [HathiTrust digital library](https://www.hathitrust.org/).  
The purpose of adapting the Python script and documentation from the GitHub repository referenced above was to customize them for use at the [University of Washington Libraries Preservation Services](http://www.lib.washington.edu/preservation) unit.  
#### Notes:  
- [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) must be installed on the computer that will be used to generate YAML files.
- The Python script for generating YAML files LINK HERE will need to be downloaded to this computer.
